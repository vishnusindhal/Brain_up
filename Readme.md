## 🖼️ UI Components & Functionality

The **UI** of Brain up is built with flexibility in mind, allowing users to interact with content in different ways. The sidebar and dynamic card components allow users to filter and display specific content based on the selected category. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### 🃏 **Card Components**
- **Card Design:** Each note or content item is displayed in a card format for a neat, visual representation. Cards can include:
  - Title of the content
  - Thumbnail (representing the relevant link or content, like an image or video preview)
  - Tags, creation date, and other metadata
  - Action buttons for further interaction (e.g., "Edit," "Delete")
  
### 🔄 **Content Filter via Sidebar**
- **Dynamic Content Display:** Depending on the category selected in the sidebar (YouTube, Document, All), the content cards will dynamically update to show only relevant notes or content. This allows users to easily filter and access specific types of information.
  - **YouTube:** Clicking on the "YouTube" section will display cards related to YouTube content, such as video, or links to related YouTube content.
  - **Document:** Clicking on the "Document" section will display card related to both Twitter and Notion — including tweet links and notes from Notion-based documents.
  - **All:** Displays all available content across all categories.

### 🧩 **"Share Your Brain" Functionality**
- Users can click on the "Share Brain" button to share their saved cards (links) with others. This feature makes it easy to collaborate and showcase your thoughts, bookmarks, or areas of interest — all in a neat card format.
